/// Represents a state that can be visited within a
/// [StateMachine] instance.
///
/// States must be created from a [StateMachine] instance:
///
///     StateMachine door = new StateMachine('door');
///
///     State isOpen = door.newState('open');
///     State isClosed = door.newState('closed');
///
///     door.start(isOpen);
///
/// There are 3 things that can be done with states:
///
/// 1. Listen for onEnter events (every time the machine enters
/// this state).
/// 2. Listen for onLeave events (every time the machine leaves
/// this state).
/// 3. Determine if the state is active (machine is currently
/// in this state).
///
/// To demonstrate:
///
///     // 1.
///     isOpen.onEnter.listen((StateChange change) {
///       // onEnter stream event always includes the StateChange info.
///       print('${change.from.name} --> ${isOpen.name}');
///     });
///
///     // 2.
///     isOpen.onLeave.listen((StateChange change) {
///       // onLeave stream event always includes the StateChange info.
///       print('${isOpen.name} --> ${change.to.name}');
///     });
///
///     // 3.
///     isOpen();   // true
///     isClosed(); // false
///
/// It's recommended that states be named in the format "isState".
/// This may seem strange at first, but it has two main benefits:
///
/// 1. It helps differentiate states from transitions, which can be confusing
/// since many words in English are the same as a verb and an adjective
/// ("open" or "secure", for example).
/// 2. It reads better when calling the state to determine if it's active,
/// as demonstrated above when calling `isOpen()` and `isClosed()`.
